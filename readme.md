# Description
## Task 1

Here is an example of a method for generating password hash:

```
public string GeneratePasswordHashUsingSalt(string passwordText, byte[] salt)
{
var iterate = 10000;
var pbkdf2 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes(passwordText, salt, iterate);
byte[] hash = pbkdf2.GetBytes(20);

byte[] hashBytes = new byte[36];
Array.Copy(salt, 0, hashBytes, 0, 16);
Array.Copy(hash, 0, hashBytes, 16, 20);

var passwordHash = Convert.ToBase64String(hashBytes);

return passwordHash;
}
```

Try to review and optimize the code to improve the performance of the method. Do not reduce iterationsâ€™ number.

## Task 2

Analyze ASP.NET MVC app from the ProfileSample.zip. Optimize the logic of retrieving images from the database. DB dump is stored in App_Data folder.

## Task 3

Optimize the code of application GameOfLife.zip. It contains memory leak and has poor performance. Try to resolve both issues.

## Task 4
